> In the database WideWorldImporters, write a SQL query which reports the highest loss of money from orders not being converted into invoices, by customer category.

> The name and id of the customer who generated this highest loss must also be identified. The resultset is ordered by highest loss.

> You should be able to write it in pure SQL, but if too challenging, you may use T-SQL and cursors.
> Resultset enclosed in Q4-Resultset.csv
